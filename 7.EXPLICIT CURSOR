EXPLICIT CURSOR :
* For Sql Statements Return A Multiple Records Is Called Explicit Cursors .
* Explicit Cursor Is Also Called As Active Set Memory Area .
* In Explicit Cursor We Are Storing The Multiple Records And 
Also These Records Are Controlled By The Database Developers Explicitly But The Database Developers Cannot Control The Implicit Cursor Memory Area .

EXPLICIT CURSOR LIFECYCLE

I)	 DECLARE
II)	 OPEN
III) FETCH
IV)	 CLOSE

DECLARE :
--------
In Declare Section Of Pl/Sql Block We Are Defining Cursor Using Following

  SYNTAX:
----------
            Cursor Cursor_Name Is Select */Col_Name From Table_Name;

OPEN :
------
Whenever We Are Opening The Cursor Then Only Oracle Server Fetch Data From The Table Into Cursor Memory Area ,
Because Whenever Opening The Cursor Then Only Cursor Select Statements Are Executed.

SYNTAX:
------
    OPEN CURSOR_NAME ;

FETCH :
----------
Using Fetch Statements ( Fetching From Cursor ) We Are Fetching The Data From The Cursor Into Pl/Sql Variables .

SYNTAX:
-----------
    Fetch Cursor_Name Into Variable1 ,Variable2 ….;

CLOSE :
----------
When We Are Closing The Cursor All The Resources Allocated From Cursor Memory Area Automatically Released  .

SYNTAX:
----------------
      Close Cursor_Name;

EXAMPLE:
------------------
WA-PLSQL program to fetch than name and salary of all the employees .


DECLARE
    V_NAME VARCHAR(20);
    V_SAL NUMBER ;
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP ;
BEGIN
   OPEN C1 ;
      FETCH C1 INTO V_NAME ,V_SAL ;
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(V_NAME||' ' ||V_SAL);
   CLOSE C1;
END ;
/

notes :
  fetch statments always return a single record or value to fetch multiple record we can use multiple fetch statments 

DECLARE
    V_NAME VARCHAR(20);
    V_SAL NUMBER ;
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP ;
BEGIN
   OPEN C1 ;
      FETCH C1 INTO V_NAME ,V_SAL ;
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(V_NAME||' ' ||V_SAL);
      FETCH C1 INTO V_NAME ,V_SAL ;
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(V_NAME||' ' ||V_SAL);
   CLOSE C1;
END ;

EXPLICIT CURSOR ATTRIBUTES:
---------------------------

Every Explicit Cursor Having Following Four Attributes:

1) %FOUND
2) %NOTFOUND
3) %ISOPEN
4) %ROWCOUNT

All These Cursor Attributes Using Along With Cursor Name Only.

SYNTAX: 
Cursor_Name%Attribute_Name 

Here are slightly more detailed, yet concise, definitions for each cursor attribute:

1. %NOTFOUND
   Returns `TRUE` if the last `FETCH` did not return any rows (i.e., no data). Returns `FALSE` if rows were fetched.

   Syntax: Cursor_Name%NOTFOUND

2. %FOUND  
   Returns `TRUE` if the last `FETCH` successfully fetched at least one row. Returns `FALSE` if no rows were fetched.

   Syntax: Cursor_Name%FOUND

3. %ISOPEN  
   Returns `TRUE` if the cursor is currently open. Returns `FALSE` if the cursor is closed.

   Syntax: Cursor_Name%ISOPEN

4. %ROWCOUNT 
   Returns the number of rows fetched so far from the cursor.

   Syntax: Cursor_Name%ROWCOUNT
   

1) DISPLAY ALL THE RECORDS FROM EMP TABLE USING EXPLICIT CURSOR LIFECYCLE?

DECLARE
    V_NAME VARCHAR(20);
    V_SAL NUMBER ;
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP ;
BEGIN
     OPEN C1 ;
       LOOP
          FETCH C1 INTO V_NAME ,V_SAL ;
          EXIT WHEN C1%NOTFOUND ;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(V_NAME||' ' ||V_SAL);
       END LOOP;
     CLOSE C1;
END ;
/

O/P :
IT RETURNS ALL THE RECORDS FROM THE TABLE 


1) Write A Pl/Sql Cursor Program To Diisplay Number Of Rows Fetched From Emp Table Using %Rowcount Attributes

DECLARE
    I EMP%ROWTYPE ;
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT * FROM EMP ;
BEGIN
    OPEN C1 ;
       FETCH C1 INTO I ;
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME||' ' ||I.SAL);
       FETCH C1 INTO I ;
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME||' ' ||I.SAL);
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( ' NO OF RECORDS FETCHED FROM THE CURSOR IS  ' || C1%ROWCOUNT );
      CLOSE C1;
END ;
/


O/P:
SMITH 800
ALLEN 1600
NO OF RECORDS FETCHED FROM THE CURSOR IS  2


2) Write A Pl/Sql Cursor Program To Diisplay Even Number Of Rows From Emp Table Using %Rowcount Attributes

DECLARE
    I EMP%ROWTYPE ;
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT * FROM EMP ;
BEGIN
    OPEN C1 ;
       LOOP
         FETCH C1 INTO I ;
         EXIT WHEN C1%NOTFOUND ;
            IF MOD(C1%ROWCOUNT,2)=0 THEN
               DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME||' ' ||I.SAL);
            END IF ;
        END LOOP;
    CLOSE C1;
END ;

3) Waqtd Name And Salary Of The Employees Who Is Earning More Than 2000

DECLARE
    I EMP%ROWTYPE ;
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT * FROM EMP ;
BEGIN
    OPEN C1 ;
        LOOP
           FETCH C1 INTO I ;
            EXIT WHEN C1%NOTFOUND ;
               IF I.SAL>2000 THEN
                    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME||' ' ||I.SAL);
              END IF ;
          END LOOP;
    CLOSE C1;
END ;

NOTES:
These Explicit Cursor Are Also Used To Transfer The Data One Oracle Table Another Oracle Table

EXAMPLE:

CREATE TABLE TARGET
(
NAME VARCHAR(20),
SAL NUMBER
);


DECLARE
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT * FROM EMP;
     I EMP%ROWTYPE ;
BEGIN
     OPEN C1 ;
        LOOP
            FETCH C1 INTO I ;
            EXIT WHEN C1%NOTFOUND ;
               INSERT INTO TARGET VALUES(I.ENAME,I.SAL);
           COMMIT ;
        END LOOP;
    CLOSE C1;
END ;
/

SELECT * FROM TARGET;
